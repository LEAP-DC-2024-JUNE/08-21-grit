          I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about React.js
          and Node.js. I excel in blending technical and visual aspects to craft
          exceptional digital products, prioritizing user experience, precise
          design, and optimized code. Since starting my web development journey
          in 2015, I've embraced challenges and kept up with the latest tech
          trends. Now in my early thirties, seven years in, I'm building
          cutting-edge web apps using Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss,
          Supabase, and more. Since starting my web development journey in 2015,
